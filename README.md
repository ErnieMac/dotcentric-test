## My Comments

*1.* I downloaded a trial version of sketch to be able to open the design

*2.* I used a CDN copy of bootstrap version 3 to create a template making sure to get the right design layout and fonts, colours etc.

*3.* I extracted some of the CSS attributes from the layout in sketch and used it in my CSS and also exported the image assets from the layout 

*4.* Unfortunately I did not have time to implement the API feature but if I had time I would've used the fetch function in JavaScript to display the data the uncompleted source file can be found in "js/services.js"

*5.* I logged into my Github account and created a repository then pushed the code from VS code terminal into the repo I created

*6.* I logged into my Netlify account and granted access to the Github repo and uploaded the source files to be deployed.
