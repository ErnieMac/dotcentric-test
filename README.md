## My Comments

### 1. Firstly I download a trial version of sketch analysed the designn

### 2. I used a CDN copy of bootstrap 3 to create a template making sure to get the right design layout and font, colour

### 3. I extract some of the CSS attributes from the layout in sketch and used it in my CSS and also exported the images assets from the layout 

### 4. Unfortunately I did not have time to implement the API feature but if I had time I would've used the fetch funtion in JavaScript to display the data api

### 5. I logged into my Github account and created  a repository then pushed the code from VS code terminal into the repo I created

### 6. I logged into my Netlify account and granted access to Github repo and upload the source files to be deployed.
